# Vibe Coding Course — Outline

## Course Title
Vibe: Building Interactive, Expressive Web Experiences

## Overview
A hands-on course teaching modern frontend techniques to build expressive, performant UIs with interactive visuals, animation, and responsive state — the "vibe" of an app.

## Target Audience
- Frontend developers with basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge
- Designers who want to implement interactive UI
- Developers familiar with React or willing to learn it

## Prerequisites
- Comfortable with JavaScript and basic React
- Node.js and npm installed
- Familiarity with CSS layout (Flexbox/Grid)

## Learning Outcomes
- Build expressive UIs with animation, shaders, and particle effects
- Structure interactive lessons and reusable components
- Deploy a small course project and share a live demo

## Course Structure (Modules)
1. Module 0 — Setup & Foundations (30–45 min)
   - Environment setup, repo, tooling (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
   - Course starter project walkthrough

2. Module 1 — Visuals & Motion Basics (1.5–2 hrs)
   - CSS transforms & transitions
   - Keyframe animations; timing and easing
   - Accessible motion and performance considerations

3. Module 2 — Canvas & WebGL Intro (2 hrs)
   - Canvas 2D basics
   - Intro to WebGL concepts and libraries
   - Simple particle system

4. Module 3 — Shaders & GLSL (2–3 hrs)
   - Shader fundamentals
   - Writing a simple fragment shader
   - Integrating shaders into React components

5. Module 4 — Interaction & State (2 hrs)
   - Pointer/touch interactions
   - Physics-based motion (spring, inertia)
   - Synchronizing visuals with app state

6. Module 5 — Polishing & Performance (1.5 hrs)
   - Optimization techniques
   - Progressive enhancement and fallbacks
   - Responsive behavior and accessibility

7. Module 6 — Project: Vibe Landing Page (3–4 hrs)
   - Build a small interactive landing page using learned techniques
   - Deploy and share

## Deliverables
- Starter repo: `courses/vibe-starter`
- Example components in `src/courses/vibe/examples`
- Lesson markdown and code snippets in `tasks/lessons/vibe/`
- Course page(s) wired into the app

## 1–3 Day Sprint: Build & Deploy

- **Goal:** ship a focused interactive piece (landing hero, particle playground, or shader banner) within 1–3 days and deploy it publicly.
- **Scope options (choose one):**
   - Interactive Hero: animated, pointer-reactive hero with CTA
   - Particle Playground: small canvas/particle system with controls
   - Shader Banner: single fragment shader integrated into React
- **Suggested cadence:**
   - Day 1 — Setup & Core Visuals: project scaffold, layout, base visuals
   - Day 2 — Interaction & Polish: pointer/touch interactions, performance tweaks
   - Day 3 — Finalize & Deploy: build, configure hosting, domain and share
- **Deliverables:** repo with README, deployed site URL, short demo screenshot or video

## Paid Deployment Option (extra fee)

- **What it includes:** production deploy to Netlify (or similar), domain setup/SSL, environment variables, build/CI wiring, basic performance checks, and a single short live-fix iteration.
- **Timeline:** 1–2 business days after project is ready.
- **Suggested pricing model:** flat fee or tiered packages (e.g., small deploy: domain + Netlify config; full deploy: domain + DNS + CI + staging). Exact pricing and terms to be defined per launch.
- **Notes for learners:** this is optional — full instructions are included so learners can self-deploy; paid option is available for hands-off launch.

## Next Steps
- Produce a detailed syllabus (module -> lesson breakdown)
- Draft Module 0 and Module 1 lesson content and examples
- Create a focused `1-3 day` sprint plan and wire the paid-deploy notes into marketing materials
