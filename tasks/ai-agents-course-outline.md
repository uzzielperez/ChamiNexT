# AI Agents — Course Outline

## Course Title
AI Agents: Building Tool-Enabled, Multi-Step Agents

## Overview
A practical course that teaches how to design and implement autonomous agents that use tools, plan multi-step tasks, handle errors, and operate safely. Learners will build a minimal agent loop, integrate mock tools, and deploy a small agent demo.

## Target Audience
- Engineers familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript and HTTP APIs
- ML engineers and product builders exploring autonomous agent patterns

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Basic understanding of prompts and LLM APIs
- Familiarity with async programming

## Learning Outcomes
- Implement a simple agent loop with planning and tool use
- Design tool interfaces and handle tool failures
- Integrate a model (or mock) for planning and reasoning
- Apply safety patterns, rate limits, and auditing

## Deliverables
- `courses/ai-agents-starter` with a minimal agent UI and mock tools
- Lesson markdown under `tasks/lessons/ai-agents/`
- Course page `src/pages/AIAgentsCoursePage.tsx`

## Next steps
1. Create a detailed syllabus with modules and lessons
2. Scaffold the starter app with mock tools and a demo agent loop
3. Add exercises and deploy options
