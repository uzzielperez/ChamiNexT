# Paid Deployment Service — Draft

This optional service provides hands-off deployment for learners who want a turnkey launch.

## Included Tasks
- Connect repo to Netlify (or preferred host) and configure build settings
- Set up DNS and domain (if requested) and ensure SSL
- Add environment variables and secrets (if needed)
- Create a simple CI flow (Netlify/GitHub Actions) for future deploys
- One short round of fixes after initial deploy (small visual/asset tweaks)
- Provide deployed URL and short handover notes

## Timeline & Pricing (example)
- Small Deploy: repo -> Netlify, basic settings, free domain setup help — $150
- Full Deploy: Domain purchase/setup, DNS, CI, small fixes — $250–$400
- Custom: quoted for larger scope (custom domains, serverless functions, integrations)

## Notes
- Learners can deploy themselves following the sprint plan; the paid service is for convenience and hands-off launches.
- Final price and terms to be agreed before work begins.
