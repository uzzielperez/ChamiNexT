This sample document explains how the small demo works. It is intentionally short. The demo shows:

- How a document is chunked and stored in a local vector store.
- How a query is embedded deterministically and nearest neighbors are retrieved.
- How retrieval results can be combined into a prompt for a model in a production setup.
